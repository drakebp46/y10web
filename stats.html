    <center>The biggest moment</center>
    <left>A simple day a simple moment. 1929 Decemeber 14th. Known as the “Rocket,” Richard was perhaps the most iconic player in the history of the Montreal Canadiens. A member of eight Stanley Cup championship teams and a 14-time All-Star, he held close to 20 National Hockey League records when he retired, including the title for most goals scored.</left>

    <p class="tab">Richard led the NHL in goals five times during his 18-season career and was the league’s all-time leader in goals at the time of his retirement. He excelled under pressure: he scored 82 playoff goals, six of them in overtime; made seven playoff hat tricks; and scored 18 game-winning playoff goals. In 1944, he scored all five goals in a 5–1 win over Toronto and was named as all three of the game’s stars (a league first). Richard was a member of eight Stanley Cup champion teams with the Montreal Canadiens. He was awarded the Hart Trophy in 1947.
